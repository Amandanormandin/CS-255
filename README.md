Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client was a driving education company that needed an online system for the projected they wanted completed. They wanted a system designed to be cloud-based, allow practice and tests to be taken on, make payments through, and track the progress of the students. The system also needed to supprt instructiors and administrators by having scheduling tools, reporting features and communication capabilities. 
What did you do particularly well?
I feel as rthough I did a good job organizing the functional and non functional requirements in a clear and concise way. I feel as though  idid well at focusing on intuitive user flows.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would spend more time on my diagrams and getting familiar with lucid chart. I feel as though understanding the UMl diagrams was the hardest part for me. 
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I tried to interperate my user's needs by analyzing the different user roles. Documenting the key goasl and pain points for the students, instructors, and admins created insights to directly shape the use cases and features for items such as scheduling, issue reporting, and progress tracking. 
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I really tried to use a user centered approach so it would  be easy for the customer to follow. Not using technical terms on my project helped make the whole thing more inclusinve. I would enhance the process by incorporating more iterative feedback loops like prototypes or usability testing.
